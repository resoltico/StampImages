 * is, whose it is, and where it came from -- which matters twice over, because
 * the build is attested on GitHub and a file that does not name its repository
 * cannot be checked against that attestation.
 *
 * Nothing here is typed twice. The version and the URL come from package.json,
 * the copyright line from LICENSE, and the macOS floor from release.mjs, so a
 * banner that disagrees with the repository is not something anyone has to
