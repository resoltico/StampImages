/*
 * The released artifact runs in JavaScriptCore under osascript, whose feature
 * set is fixed by the user's macOS version. ESLint's `ecmaVersion` constrains
 * syntax, but a late *built-in* is ordinary syntax calling an ordinary method,
 * so nothing in a parser will flag it. It fails at runtime, on the user's Mac,
 * with a TypeError.
 *
 * The floor is macOS 12.3, whose JavaScriptCore corresponds to Safari 15.4.
 * Everything below is what landed after that. Each entry names the first
 * JavaScriptCore release that has it.
 *
 * No ECMAScript year maps exactly onto a Safari release: ES2022 as a whole is
 * not in 15.4, even though its built-ins are. That is why static blocks appear
 * here despite `ecmaVersion: 2022` accepting them.
 *
 * Known gap: regular-expression *flags* are not inspected, so the ES2022 `d`
 * flag would not be caught here. Nothing in src/ uses it, and ESLint requires
 * every regex to carry `u`, which makes an accidental `d` unlikely.
