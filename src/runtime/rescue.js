 * nothing to do with its contents -- and the workspace it sits in is removed
 * as soon as the run ends. It is moved out of the way instead, and where it
 * went is part of the failure.
 *
 * Best effort: if it cannot be moved it stays where it was built, and the
 * message says so rather than claiming a rescue that did not happen.
