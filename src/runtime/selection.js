/*
 * What was actually selected, each thing once.
 *
 * Identity is settled here, for everything, before anything is admitted --
 * because two names for one thing used to be two things. A folder selected
 * alongside a photo inside it converted that photo twice, and selecting them
 * the other way round made the folder report that it held nothing to convert:
 * the answer depended on the order Finder happened to hand the selection over.
 *
 * Two names for one thing is also what a Mac's own filesystem hands over. It
 * is case-insensitive as formatted, so /photos/A.jpg and /photos/a.jpg are
 * one photograph -- measured, the same volume and the same file number -- and
 * standardizing the spelling does not make them one selection. What the
 * filesystem says the file is does, and every root carries it.
 *
 * It is carried rather than used as the key. Keyed by it, the first spelling
 * of a file was the only one considered, and whether that spelling was one
 * this action could convert had not been asked yet: two hard links to one
 * photograph, one named .jpg and one named .backup, meant the .backup was
 * turned away and the .jpg vanished from the run without being converted or
 * reported. Which requests there are is settled here; which of them convert
 * the same file is settled where they are admitted.
 *
 * What each selected path is was asked of the shell, too, which cannot tell a
 * package from a folder. An .app or a .photoslibrary answered "directory", so
 * the walk went inside the bundle and the output was written in there.
 *
 * So every path is standardized and asked what it is through the same tree
 * that will do the walking. Nothing is dropped for where its name sits: a
 * folder covering a path is not the same as the walk taking it -- the walk
 * passes over hidden entries, packages and links -- and dropping an explicit
 * request on that assumption removed it from the run without a word. What
 * was taken is settled by the walk itself, in admission.js.
 *
 * The order is the answer to that: folders first and in path order, so an
 * ancestor is always walked before a folder inside it, and every explicit
 * request is considered after the walking is done.

 * What the path is and which file it is, as the tree that would walk it sees

 * package, so there is nothing to ask: such a folder is turned away by the

 * and a path is the only identity there is.
