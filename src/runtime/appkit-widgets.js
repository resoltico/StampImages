 * Every function takes the ObjC namespace as its first parameter rather than
 * reaching for the `$` global, which is what lets the composition above be
 * driven by a fake in tests. What a fake cannot prove is that AppKit renders
 * any of it; that was established by running a probe inside the Shortcuts
 * helper, and is why appkit.js keeps the stepwise dialogs as a fallback.

 * Deliberately branchless: anything with a decision in it belongs in
