 * One rule, and it is about ownership rather than about inspection: this run
 * removes only the names it took, and the copy stays in the workspace until
 * the output path has been checked.
 *
 * Both halves were learned the hard way. The workspace copy used to be moved
 * into the output folder, so a failure afterwards had to work out where the
 * bytes were -- through a check that answers "no" both when a file is absent
 * and when the question could not be put at all, so a refused check deleted
 * the finished copy and reported it missing. And what to clear away used to be
 * worked out from pathnames rather than recorded: a file another program had
 * put at the staging name, and a document inside a folder that appeared at
 * the output path, were both deleted for having a name this run recognised.
