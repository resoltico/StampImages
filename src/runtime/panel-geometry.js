 * Where the three things in the progress panel sit.

 * One fixed-size window with a headline, a detail line and a bar, laid out in
 * AppKit's bottom-left coordinate space from a top-down description: padding,
 * headline, gap, detail, gap, bar, padding. Stated as arithmetic so the rects
 * can be checked against each other rather than eyeballed against a screenshot
 * nothing here can take.
 *
 * The panel does not resize. A window that grows a bar when the total becomes
 * known would move under the eye of somebody already reading it, so the bar's
 * room is reserved from the start and the bar itself is hidden until there is
 * a total to draw.
