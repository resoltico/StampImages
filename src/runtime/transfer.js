/*
 * Getting the finished copy from the workspace to the name the user will see.
 *
 * Claiming the name is claim.js's business, and both ways of doing it need
 * their source on the destination's own volume. This is about getting the copy
 * there, and about doing it without ever letting go of the finished file.
 *
 * The claim is made from the workspace itself whenever it can be, which is
 * whenever the two are on one volume: the ordinary case, where the whole
 * publication is one operation and no file of ours appears in the output
 * folder under any other name. That claim is a link and only a link -- it
 * must not give up the copy, because a failure afterwards has to still have
 * one to give back.
 *
 * Otherwise the copy is put into a place this run makes beside the
 * destination and claimed from there, where both operations are allowed
 * because the original is still in the workspace behind them.
 *
 * Renaming straight to the final name is what the copy replaced, and it is
 * atomic only when both ends are on one volume. Across volumes Apple's mv
 * copies to the pathname it is given: measured on an attached test volume, an
 * interrupted move left 3,211,264 bytes of a 1,258,291,200-byte file under
 * exactly the name the finished document was to have.
 *
 * What none of this decides is whether publication succeeded. That is settled
 * afterwards, by asking the output path which file it holds.
 */

/*
 * Why the link from the workspace was refused is half the story when the copy
 * cannot even be made. Once the copy is there it is not: what happens at the
 * destination speaks for itself, and a cross-volume link that was never going
 * to work explains nothing about it.
