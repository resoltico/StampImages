/*
 * A selected folder means "stamp the photographs in here", not "stamp
 * everything in here".
 *
 * One fixed policy, with nothing to configure. What is discovered inside a
 * folder is taken when it is a supported image and passed over otherwise --
 * silently, because nobody asked for the other files and a folder of
 * documents would otherwise report a rejection for every one of them. What
 * was selected by hand is different: it was asked for, so if it cannot be
 * stamped it is reported, and admission.js sees to that.
 *
 * What cannot be passed over silently is what the walk could not look at. A
 * folder it could not read, and an entry it could not get the attributes of,
 * are both things that might have been photographs -- so a run that leaves
 * them out and reports success is a run that lost work quietly. A listing can
 * succeed while inspecting what it listed fails: a folder with read but not
 * execute permission does exactly that.
 *
 * Dot-prefixed entries, packages and links are passed over. A link is not
 * followed because following one is how a walk leaves the folder it was given
 * and how it finds the same file twice.
 *
 * What the ledger holds is which file was taken, not which name it was taken
 * under. A Mac is formatted case-insensitively by default, so /photos/A.jpg
 * and /photos/a.jpg are one photograph, and a run that compared the spellings
 * stamped it twice.
