/*
 * A place of this run's own, beside the destination, to put the stamped copy
 * in when it cannot be linked into place from the workspace.
 *
 * Made rather than found: mkdir either creates the directory or fails, and it
 * fails for anything already at that name -- a file, a folder, a link, a
 * named pipe. Measured, all four. So everything inside it is this attempt's,
 * which is what makes copying into it and clearing it away afterwards safe.
 *
 * Taking a name by opening it was not the same thing. The shell's noclobber
 * redirection refuses a regular file, and quietly accepts a link pointing at
 * something that is not one -- measured, a link to /dev/null was accepted and
 * nothing was created, so the run recorded a name it did not own and cleanup
 * deleted the link. On a named pipe it does worse: it waits for a reader, and
 * there is no timeout above it to end that wait.
 *
 * Hidden, and named for this attempt, so it is neither in the way nor
 * something another run would ask for.
 */

/*
 * Named for what it holds and given the kind of file it is. Nothing reads the
 * staged copy by its extension -- publication is a rename -- but a copy a
 * failed run had to leave behind is one somebody opens, and a file with no
 * extension is one they cannot.
