 * A place of this run's own in the output folder.
 *
 * Made rather than found. mkdir either creates the directory or fails, and it
 * fails for anything already at that name -- measured against a file, a
 * folder, a link and a named pipe. Taking a name by opening it is not the
 * same: the shell's noclobber redirection accepted a link pointing at
 * /dev/null without creating anything, so the run recorded a name it did not
 * own, and on a named pipe it waited for a reader that never came.
