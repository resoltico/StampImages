 * The AppKit objects the progress panel is made of.
 *
 * No headless test can prove AppKit drew any of this. What is checked is that
 * each object is asked for with the properties the panel depends on -- and
 * two of those are load-bearing in a way that is invisible from a screenshot:
 * a utility panel that does not clear hidesOnDeactivate is built, ordered
 * front and hidden again, and a non-activating mask is the difference between
 * saying what the run is doing and taking the machine over while it does it.
