# holding anything open: the run that wrote the copy exited before this is
# called, and the test has already established that nothing was left behind.

# So waiting is the answer, and forcing is what is left when waiting has
# plainly not worked. A detach that fails after both still fails the test,
# because the next volume cannot be attached over one that is still there.
