## Working on this

```sh
npm ci
npm run release
```

`npm run release` regenerates `dist/` and runs the full gate. `npm run quality`
runs the gate without regenerating, which is what CI does, so that a stale
committed artifact fails instead of shipping.

The macOS integration gate needs the real tools and is run separately:

```sh
brew install exiftool vips shellcheck actionlint
npm run test:integration:macos
```

## What the gate enforces

`QA.md` is the contract. It specifies every check, its threshold, and why the
guard exists — file size, coverage, ESLint mode, the language target, mutation
score, and the facts that must agree across files.

This file does not restate those rules, so that there is one place to change
when they move.

Two things worth knowing before you write code, because they shape where things
go rather than merely passing or failing:

- **A test belongs in `tests/unit/` if it takes its world by parameter, and in
  `tests/repo/` if it inspects the real repository.** Only the former is
  meaningful under mutation, where the tree is deliberately altered.
- **Rules that are switched off are listed with their reasons** in
  `tools/eslint/rules.mjs`. Add to that list only with a reason, never in bulk.

## Source layout

`src/` holds small single-purpose CommonJS modules so each can be required and
unit tested on its own:

- `src/core/` — the portable half, which knows nothing about macOS: paths,
  naming, ordering, colours, numbers, shell quoting, invocation parsing,
  preflight probes, errors, and this product's own decisions — what a moment
  is, how a place is written, what the stamp will say, where it goes, what the
  form asks, and what a setting may be.
- `src/runtime/` — the macOS host: shell execution, tool discovery, preflight,
  the filesystem walk, input resolution, admission, the font probe, the stamp
  renderer, the image pipeline, publication, the progress panel, the AppKit
  form, the stepwise dialogs, the receipt, entry point.

The split is about testability rather than tidiness. Everything in `src/core/`
is a pure function over plain values, so what the tools are told and what the
form asks are asserted directly rather than inferred from a run. `QA.md`
records what came from where, and what has not been established.

Two values are worth knowing about before you change anything in the middle of
the program. `src/core/inscription.js` is what this run will write on one
photograph, built from the metadata and the settings before the photograph is
decoded — or the reason it will write nothing on it. The rule it exists for is
that **nothing downstream of it may decide not to draw something**: if there
is an inscription it is drawable, and if there is not, the photograph was one
the request did not apply to and the report says so. Six defects were one
defect before it existed, each stage coping locally with a decision nobody
owned.

The runtime layer takes `app` as a parameter rather than reaching for a global,
which is what lets the whole macOS host be driven from Node by a fake host with
an in-memory filesystem — including the non-clobbering publish, which a
stateless stub cannot exercise.

Each module has its own test file under `tests/unit/core/` or
`tests/unit/runtime/`.

## The released artifact

Do not edit it. `dist/Stamp-Images.jxa` is generated from the modules
under `src/` by `tools/bundle.mjs`, which concatenates the module bodies with
their `require`, `module.exports` and strict directive removed. Everything then
shares one script scope and `run` stays top level, where `osascript` finds it.
The bundler fails the build on a duplicate top-level name or an out-of-order
dependency.

Those are found in the syntax tree rather than by matching lines, so what the
build recognises does not depend on how the sources happen to be formatted. The
same applies to the comments, which are removed from the artifact — the file is
pasted into a Shortcuts editor whose size ceiling nobody knows, and the header
says where the sources are. What is removed is removed by byte range, and the
build then asserts that what is left has the same token sequence as what it
started with; a build step that changed the program cannot reach the disk.

The parsing lives in `tools/javascript.mjs`, the CommonJS shapes in
`tools/commonjs.mjs`, the removal in `tools/excise.mjs`, and the header in
`tools/banner.mjs`, which quotes the version and URL from `package.json` and
the copyright line from `LICENSE` so the artifact cannot misstate them.

Edit the sources, run `npm run release`, and commit both.

`INSTALL.txt` ships with it, and is deliberately plain text rather than
Markdown. It is a release asset: someone downloads it alongside the `.jxa` and
opens it in a text editor, where `##` and backticks would be clutter rather
than formatting. The repository's own documents are Markdown because they are
read rendered on GitHub. Do not convert it.

## Releasing

A release is a tag. Pushing `v<version>` runs the release workflow, which
qualifies the tagged source on macOS, rebuilds the artifact on a clean runner,
and publishes it with a build attestation.

Three things are checked that a local build cannot check:

- **The tag names the version the repository already agrees on.**
  `tools/check-tag.mjs` compares it against the value the consistency gate
  derives from all six declarations of it, so tagging cannot paper over a
  disagreement.
- **The build is reproducible.** CI runs `npm run check-dist` first, so the
  committed artifact is proven to match `src/` while it is still untouched,
  then rebuilds and requires `git diff --exit-code -- dist/` to be clean. What
  is attested is therefore both built on GitHub and identical to what was
  reviewed here.
- **The tag still points at the commit being built.** A tag can be moved after
  it is pushed; the publish job re-resolves it and `gh release create
  --verify-tag` refuses one that has since changed.

Release notes come from `CHANGELOG.md` rather than a per-tag file, because a
second copy of the same prose is a second thing to keep in agreement.

Building locally is unchanged: `npm run release` still builds and gates, and
the committed `dist/` is still what the repository is reviewed against.

## Bumping Node

The Node version appears in `.node-version`, `mise.toml` and `engines`. The
gate asserts they agree, but nothing watches for newer releases: Dependabot
does not track version files, so bumping is a deliberate manual step.

The Homebrew tools are not pinned at all — CI installs the current ones on
every run, so a breaking change there surfaces as a failing integration job
rather than as a silent drift.
